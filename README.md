## ❓ Key Business Questions Answered  
- 📈 Are there noticeable **sales trends over time**?  
- 🏆 Which are the **best and worst-selling products**?  
- 👤 Can you identify any **key customers**?  
- 🚚 Are **shipping costs consistent** across providers? 

## Key Insights
- **Sales Trends:** A clear seasonal trend, with Q4 2014 being a significant outlier. The decline into 2015 warrants further investigation (e.g., market changes, operational issues).
- **Sales Volatility:** Q4 2014 shows a massive sales spike, this is a trend worth replicating through planned promotions or seasonal campaigns.
- **Product Performance:** Côte de Blaye is the best-selling product, suggesting strong market preference.
- **Product Leaders:** Côte de Blaye clearly dominates, while Alice Mutton and Longlife Tofu underperform.
- **Customer Segmentation:** A small group of customers contributes significantly to overall sales, showing heavy dependence on key accounts.
- **Customer Dependence:** A few customers (top 3) account for a major portion of sales, which poses concentration risk
- **Shipping Cost Disparity:** Costs are skewed toward Federal Shipping, possibly due to volume deals or service area coverage.
- **Shipping Imbalance:** Federal Shipping handles the largest share of orders, possibly due to reliability or pricing.

## Recommendations
- **Investigate Sales Dip in 2015:** Conduct deeper analysis by month and region to understand what affected post-2014 performance.
- **Target Repeat of Q4 2014 Strategy:** Investigate what drove high performance and replicate it annually (e.g., discounts, festive promotions).
- **Phase Out or Repackage Underperformers:** Consider marketing or discontinuing bottom-performing products to optimize inventory.
- **Target Key Customers:** Strengthen relationships with top clients through loyalty programs or volume discounts.
- **Broaden Customer Base:** Reduce dependency on a few large clients by expanding reach via digital marketing or distributor partnerships.
- **Optimize Shipping Strategy:** Negotiate better rates with high-cost providers or consider load balancing across shippers.
- **Audit Shipping Contracts:** Consider renegotiating terms with Federal Shipping or optimizing routing logic to balance load and cost.
- **Improve Data Labeling:** Ensure accurate labeling—no inconsistencies observed this time, unlike the prior dashboard.
- **Expand Underperforming Products or Retire Them:** Depending on market demand and profitability.
